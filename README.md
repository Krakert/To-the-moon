# Stefan de Kraker IoT individual project
For this individual project I have chosen for the blueprint: "To the moon".
This blueprint focus on making a device that keeps an eye on your savings in the crypto market.
Therefore I'm making a small embedded devices that will show this.
On this Gitlab repo you will find everything you need to know to about the project.
